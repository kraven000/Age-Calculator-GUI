## 📚 How It Works

2. When you select a date, it is displayed for confirmation.
3. Clicking **"Calculate Age"** compares the selected date with today’s date to determine your age.

## 💡 Future Improvements

* Prevent selection of future dates.
* Make the layout responsive (use `.grid()` instead of `.place()`).
* Add more detailed error messages.
* Support months and days in the age calculation.
